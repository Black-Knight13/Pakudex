# Pakudex
This Python code utilizes the Pakudex class for managing a fictional creature collection. The program begins by prompting the user to set the maximum capacity of the Pakudex and handles invalid entries. It then creates an instance of the Pakudex class with the specified capacity. The main menu provides options such as listing Pakuri, showing detailed information about a specific species, adding new Pakuri (with capacity checks), evolving a Pakuri, sorting Pakuri, and exiting the program. The code includes error handling for various scenarios, such as a full Pakudex, non-existent species, and unrecognized menu selections. Overall, this script serves as a text-based interface for interacting with and managing a collection of Pakuri creatures.
